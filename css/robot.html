		<p><img src="pics/nano.jpg" alt="Nano Bots" id="nanoPic" width="320" height="270 " /> Our nanobots are the latest advancement in medical technology. The NMAC (National Medication Assessment Counsil) has stated, onthe record, <em>"These 'nanobots' are very advanced, for they act as artificial white blood cells and/or antibodies. Some even do tasks already performed by the human body, but better."</em> Each seperate model carries out their own unique task to safley speed up the healing process. To the left is a list of all our models and their names. Below is what they are programmed to do in the order in which they appear on the list.</p>
